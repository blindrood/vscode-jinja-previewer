# jinjer Jinja Previewer for VS Code

Preview Jinja templates directly within VS Code. This extension leverages a built-in webview to render Jinja templates, simplifying the development process and eliminating the need for constant browser refreshes.

## Features

* Live Preview: See your Jinja templates rendered in real-time as you edit them. Changes are reflected instantly in the preview pane.
* Context Support: Define context variables within a dedicated configuration file to populate your templates with dynamic data. The extension supports JSON and YAML for defining context.
* Customizable Settings: Tailor the preview behavior to your preferences, including options for auto-refresh and context file location.
* Error Reporting: Clear error messages are displayed in the preview pane if issues occur during template rendering.
* Support for Includes and Macros: Preview Jinja templates that leverage includes and macros.

## Known Issues

* Complex Jinja features that rely on external dependencies or system-level access might not be fully supported within the preview.
* Performance might be affected when working with very large or complex templates.
